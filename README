# Description

This is a fork of 9front's drawterm with the build system replaced by `build.zig`.

# Build

Native build:

```
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

Cross build:

```
zig build -Dtarget=x86-windows-gnu -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

# Bugs

* `Debug` builds produce faulty executables with `UD1` instructions inserted all
  over the place.  Release builds work fine.
* Only tested with native `x86_64-linux-gnu` build and cross-compiled for
  `x86-windows-gnu`.
* Currently we rely on system library dependencies, which is fine for most
  cases.  Eventually I'd like to have the dependencies included and built from
  source to produce self-contained binaries. This is also important for cross-
  compilation.
